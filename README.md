# Python Data Structures

## Description
This is a simple script to display knowledge of different python data structures. I have submitted this as my assignment for the Python module; for the PLP programme.

## What it does
- Creates an empty list called my_list.
- Appends the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40.
- Inserts the value 15 at the second position in the list.
- Extends my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].
- Removes the last element from my_list.
- Sorts my_list in ascending order.
- Finds and prints the index of the value 30 in my_list.

## How to Use
- To run the script using Python, enter the following command on the command-line :
```bash
   python app.py
```
